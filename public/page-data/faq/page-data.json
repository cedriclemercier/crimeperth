Doctors, nurses, and lab technicians are not the only ones at risk. People working in law enforcement, coroners, medical examiners, property management, veterinary medicine, waste management, manufacturing, agriculture, and other professions are also at a high risk for workplace biohazards, along with any worker who has been exposed to the scene of an industrial accident.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3>How to Protect Yourself from Biohazards at Work</h3>\n<p>You can take several precautions to protect yourself from biohazards in the workplace. Some of these include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Treating each situation as potentially dangerous. Don’t ever assume a situation involving biohazards will be fine to respond to without proper precautions.</li>\n<li>Washing your hands frequently with warm water and soap.</li>\n<li>Wearing personal protective equipment (PPE) when responding to situations involving biohazards. These can include gloves, face masks and shields, respirators, aprons, special protective eyewear, and full body gowns or suits.</li>\n<li>Utilising appropriate disposal methods including labelled biohazard bags or containers.</li>\n<li>Reporting all incidents to your supervisor.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<p>When dealing with workplace biohazards, any potential contact should be treated with the utmost care to avoid risk and harm to employees. As a result, it is often best to call a bioremediation company for help with biohazards clean ups. <a href=\"http://crimescenecleanerperth.com.au\">Crime Scene Cleaner Perth</a> is an industry leader in biohazard remediation processes to ensure your workplace is clean and safe for everyone.

This odour permeates contents and structural elements of the property and can be difficult to remove. The lingering odour and airborne bacteria that a decomposing body produces can ruin household items in just a few days.</p>\n<h2 style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Removing the Odour left from Death</h2>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Removing the odours caused by a decomposing body should be handled by a suitably qualified professional. Any disposable supplies used in the clean-up must be properly discarded and transported. Biohazard remediation companies such as Crime Scene Cleaners Perth are trained on how to handle a wide range of situations and possess the knowledge, experience, tools, and protective equipment to complete the job wholly. Some of the supplies and chemicals utilised include:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 60px;\">Biohazard waste containers</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 60px;\">Ozone generators (to remove odours)</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 60px;\">Hospital-grade disinfectants</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 60px;\">Enzyme solvents</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 60px;\">Chemical treatment tanks</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Repainting your property and getting new carpet can help out with combating the smell left behind from a dead body. But these measures do not protect against exposure to the dangerous bacteria that is present.</p>\n<h2 style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Professional Death and Odour Removal Specialists</h2>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Any amount of human waste can be hazardous to our health. In fact, federal regulations deem all bodily fluids to be biohazards, and any blood, tissue, or bodily fluids at a scene are considered a potential source of infection. This includes odours that are left behind even after the body has been removed from the scene.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Here at Crime Scene Cleaners Perth, we believe that dealing with the emotional loss of a loved one is hard enough and that no family deserves to be plagued by disturbing images of decomposition, odour and potential health hazards. As the Western Australia’s leading biohazard remediation provider, we handle traumatic situations on a daily basis. Above all, our mission is to relieve each customer’s burden by providing compassionate, customer-centric, conscientious care in the delivery of our services.</p>\n","slug":"dealing-with-death-and-odour-cleaning","tags":{"nodes":[{"name":"Biohazard Remediation Clean Ups","slug":"biohazard-remediation-clean-ups"},{"name":"Crime Scene Cleaners Perth","slug":"crime-scene-cleaners-perth"},{"name":"Death Scene Cleaning Perth","slug":"death-scene-cleaning-perth"},{"name":"Unattended Death Clean Ups Perth","slug":"unattended-death-clean-ups-perth"}]},"author":{"node":{"name":"admin"}},"excerpt":""}},{"node":{"date":"2018-08-02T04:27:15","title":"5 Warning Signs of a Hoarding Disorder","content":"<p>To many people, it is difficult to understand hoarding disorders or how people that struggle with hoarding issues can allow their homes to fall into a messy and dangerous condition. There are between 10 and 15 million Americans that struggle with hoarding issues and their disorder typically goes through stages that get increasingly more severe as the disorder develops. Matt Paxton, the host of the television show “Hoarders” and founder of ServiceMaster’s hoarding solutions program, has come up with 5 stages of hoarding that he presents at his speaking engagements to educate people on the warning signs of hoarding and what causes hoarding.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3>Emotional Cause</h3>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1458\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1458\" style=\"width: 300px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-1458\" src=\"http://crimescenecleanerperth.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/warning-signs-of-hoarding-crime-scene-cleaners-perth-300x183.jpg\" alt=\"hoarder clean ups perth\" width=\"300\" height=\"183\" srcset=\"https://admin.crimescenecleanerperth.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/warning-signs-of-hoarding-crime-scene-cleaners-perth-300x183.jpg 300w, https://admin.crimescenecleanerperth.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/warning-signs-of-hoarding-crime-scene-cleaners-perth.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1458\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The biggest sign of a hoarder in this stage is that the individual will start buying things in bulk to have more physical objects around them.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>In almost all cases of hoarding, there is an emotional trigger that can be pinpointed to the start of the problem. This emotional cause can be grief from a variety of scenarios such as the loss of a loved one, a divorce, or disease among others.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3>Physical Replacement</h3>\n<p>When hoarding disorders intensify, the individual will place their self-worth in physical objects. The biggest sign of a hoarder in this stage is that the individual will start buying things in bulk to have more physical objects around them.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3>Avoidance</h3>\n<p>If you have a family member or close friend that you suspect may be a hoarder, pay attention to who they allow in their home, if anyone. Someone who is preventing friends or family members from entering their home may be doing it to avoid confronting their hoarding issue.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3>Negative Physical Replacement</h3>\n<p>As the hoarding disorder develops, the physical replacement becomes more extreme as objects begin replacing friends and family in importance. This is especially apparent if a hoarder has lost a loved one and responds by getting more objects or animals to clutter their home.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3>Dangerous Condition</h3>\n<p>As the hoard of collected items within a home grows, it begins to restrict access by blocking off certain areas of the home and it can harbour harmful mould and bacteria growth which makes the house dangerous to live in. This is usually the stage when family members recognise that an individual is hoarding and help with the hoarding clean-up process.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>It is important to keep in mind that everyone is different and these signs of hoarding may not manifest themselves in the same way in each individual case. But if you notice any similarity between these signs of a hoarder and the actions of a friend or family member that you suspect of hoarding, it is best to approach this individual about their hoarding disorder before it develops into a more severe case.</p>\n<p>A friend or family member of a hoarder normally assumes the responsibility of helping a hoarder clean out their home and there are professional services that can help. <a href=\"http://crimescenecleanerperth.com.au/\">Crime Scene Cleaners Perth</a> technicians offer hoarding clean-up services to determine the best way to approach an individual who hoards as well as the appropriate cleaning methods.</p>\n","slug":"5-warning-signs-of-a-hoarding-disorder","tags":{"nodes":[{"name":"hoarders clean ups perth","slug":"hoarders-clean-ups-perth"}]},"author":{"node":{"name":"admin"}},"excerpt":""}},{"node":{"date":"2018-01-14T23:09:31","title":"Reasons for Water Stains on the Ceiling","content":"<p>Nothing can be more worrying than to find a ceiling water stain. Every time you look up, your eyes just end up wandering back to that ugly spot. And if you’re like many property owners, it will bug you until it’s fixed. But what’s more important is figuring out what caused it so it doesn’t happen again in the future.</p>\n<p>While finding the source of the damage can be difficult, inspecting the surrounding areas would be the first step towards finding it. Identifying the cause can also determine whether or not this can be a DIY project.</p>\n<p>If the damage has spread throughout a larger area after finding an untreated leak, don’t hesitate to address the problem immediately. Whether you need to call a plumber for a pipe leak or a roofing contractor for a roof leak, do so immediately. Then to repair the damaged area, call a water damage restoration company.

Although you may want to check the floorboards last to avoid removing parts of the floor. But if you have checked all other areas, listen carefully to see if you can hear water running through the building materials. If so, the damage was caused by a leaking pipe under floors and behind walls.</p>\n<p><strong>Old and Out-dated Piping</strong>: Especially for older homes, the plumbing system may be out-dated and develop leaks more easily than others. In other cases, the pipes can also “sweat” water, in which the insulation is cheap, old, or installed improperly, causing water to drip from the pipes.</p>\n<p><strong>Roof Problems</strong>: For water stains on ceilings on the top floor of the home or building, you will have to grab a ladder and climb onto your roof to find the problem. You may also need to hire a roofing contractor for this job, but at least you will have already identified the problem, thus keeping labour costs efficient.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Never Ignore Ceiling Water Damage</h3>\n<p>While addressing ceiling water stains is never an exciting task to do on the weekends, ignoring the damage will only lead to bigger problems down the road.

Forensic cleaning companies are trained in local and federal rules and regulations that impact returning your property to a livable condition.

Before forensic clean up begins, the technicians establish three zones: The control zone (where the clean up takes place), the buffer zone (where technicians put on personal protective equipment), and the clean zone (where technicians store their equipment). The purpose of forensic cleaners establishing these three zones is to prevent cross contamination of the worksite and help prevent the transmission of potential blood borne pathogens.</li>\n<li>Personal Protective Equipment (PPE).

What many people do not realise is that cleaning up the scene is largely the responsibility of the family, an unthinkable task for those mourning the unexpected death of a family member or friend. On top of the emotional trauma that goes along with a suicide clean-up, there are health hazards to consider as well. The scene of a suicide is likely a traumatic one, with bodily components that can pose serious health threats such as HIV and hepatitis, viruses that do not necessarily show outward signs of illness.

Our team will also keep our work entirely confidential.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>It is only after you or your loved one has admitted to a hoarding problem that you can seek for help, but, you need to recognise the symptoms or signs first. People who suffer from a hoarding disorder will keep all kinds of items with a lot of it not having any important value. This can include newspapers, broken appliances, junk mail and a lot of irrelevant things. It can be very difficult to persuade hoarders to dispose of useless items as they think that the items are repairable in the future.</p>\n<h3>Loss of Space in The House</h3>\n<p>People who have hoarding disorders are reluctant to throw away old belongings, and they begin to run out of space around the house. Those saved belongings may be organised initially, but eventually they can spread around the house and make your living space uncomfortable and uninhabitable.</p>\n<h3>Unclean and Disorganised Atmosphere</h3>\n<p>If you notice that any of your family has so much clutter around the house that there is no sense of organisation, the person might have a hoarding disorder. This great sense of disorganisation can lead to a very crowded and unsanitary living condition. Many hoarders can’t locate items in their home because there is too much clutter to enable them to effectively find any.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Gross Filth and Hoarding can cause significant issues to those living in this kind of environment with an increased level of pollutants in the air and biological risks with increased levels of mildew and mould growth as well as rodents, faeces and urine which can have severe health implications if not remediated. Additionally, living in a house with a gross filth, squaller or hoarding issue can lead to the increased risk of a fall and in some extreme cases, being trapped among the hoarding mess. Potential structural damage can occur to the property if the hoarding mess is left for an extended period of time and the risk of a house fire increases significantly.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://crimescenecleanerperth.com.au/\">Crime Scene Cleaners Perth</a> technicians provide a compassionate and understanding gross filth and hoarders clean up service with a tactful, respectful and caring approach during the entire process and are able to encourage your loved one to find a happy and healthy balance between items that are important and have sentimental value to keep, and the items that are not needed.</p>\n<p>There is no shame in this struggle, and you should never be made to feel bad about this.
