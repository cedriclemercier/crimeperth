Crime scenes,\n    blood and trauma, clandestine drug labs and more all require specialist and certified forensic cleaning remediation\n    professionals to ensure the affected area is left in a safe and biohazard free state. There is never an easy time to\n    deal with the cleaning and restoration of a situation that requires forensic cleaning specialists. One of the many\n    unfortunate truths about a crime scene is that the loved ones of the victims are left to clean up the area. When\n    this type of situation occurs, it is imperative the remediation process begins as soon as possible. When an\n    unexpected event leaves you with a painful loss and the requirement for Forensic Cleaning or Biohazard Cleaning in\n    Perth, Crime Scene Cleaner Perth technicians are here to help alleviate the stresses associated with the remediation\n    process\n  </p>\n\n  <h2>Prompt and Reliable Forensic Cleaning Biological Remediation in Perth</h2>\n  <p style=\"text-align: left\">\n    The skills which are required to conduct forensic cleaning to a high standard are highly specialised.

Forensic Cleaning deals with the\n    sanitisation of biological agents that can cause illness, injury, and death in living organisms. This includes\n    animal and human blood and bodily tissues, viruses, bacteria, parasites and faecal matter. What may seem like a\n    localised and harmless cleaning job or contamination can be severely misleading. Many of these organisms can live on\n    surfaces for many hours or days and spread through various means without proper cleaning protocols.\n  </p>\n\n  <h2>Why Choose Crime Scene Cleaner Perth for your Forensic Cleaning Biological Restorations in Perth</h2>\n  <p style=\"text-align: left\">\n    A common misconception is that all areas can be fully remediated, however, saturated and porous materials such as\n    carpets, furnishings, bedding and other belongings must be removed, replaced, and disposed of properly. Forensic\n    cleaning is a critical part of the after care of any location that has been the scene of any serious incident\n    involving injury or loss of life.

However, hoarding is generally thought to be a form of Obsessive\n    Compulsive Disorder and when the hoarding becomes too much to handle, the property can become dangerous for the\n    hoarder and their family to occupy. Characterised by an extreme difficulty to part with or discard possessions, a\n    person with a hoarding disorder can become extremely agitated and distressed with the idea of getting rid of even\n    the most basic of items.

Additionally, living in a\n    house with a gross filth, squaller or hoarding issue can lead to the increased risk of a fall and in some extreme\n    cases, being trapped among the hoarding mess.

When a loved one passes away, coping with their death can be difficult for their relatives and\n    friends. Often what isn’t thought about is what happens next – having to remove blood, bodily fluids and odour can\n    be an arduous task, which cannot normally be performed by standard household or commercial cleaning methods. Death\n    and Suicide Cleaning in Perth and all Western Australian regions requires a rigorous, multi-step process to remove\n    all traces of bio hazardous materials. Crime Scene Cleaner Perth forensic biological cleaners and technicians\n    possess the skills and technical knowledge to successfully and expertly remediate any property requiring death and\n    suicide cleaning in Perth and Western Australia.\n  </p>\n\n  <h2>Why Death & Suicide Cleaning Biological Cleaning Services are Imperative in Perth</h2>\n  <p style=\"text-align: left\">\n    In the case of an death and suicide clean up in Perth, the human body begins to decay only 15 minutes after the\n    heart stops beating, and if left for day or weeks, widespread contamination will occur in the property including\n    body fluid leaching into the flooring, walls, sub-flooring and furnishings. Additionally, an infestation of insects\n    such as flies and cockroaches will occur and lay their eggs in and around the decomposing body that in turn, speeds\n    up the decomposition process. Many unattended death and suicide cleaning situations pose serious health risks to\n    property owners and occupants, and the biohazard remediation technicians due to the potential exposure to blood\n    borne pathogens. Exposure to blood borne viruses can occur due to direct contact with scratches and sores,\n    accidental injury from biological waste, inhalation and exposure from blood or biological hazardous fluid to the\n    eyes, nose or mouth. Considering the health risks, Crime Scene Cleaner Perth technicians are adept in death and\n    suicide cleaning bioremediation and follow stringent health and safety regulations and meticulous decontamination\n    procedures most clean up technicians are not accustomed to.\n  </p>\n\n  <h2>Why Crime Scene Cleaner Perth Death and Suicide Technicians are Experts in their Biological Field</h2>\n  <p style=\"text-align: left\">\n    Crime Scene Cleaner Perth’s fully qualified and trained Unattended Death and Suicide Clean Up technicians possess\n    the skills and industry-specific knowledge to successfully remediate any property affected. Calling a professional\n    company to handle a Death and Suicide Clean up in Perth and Western Australia reduces your risk of coming into\n    contact with the biological and hazardous materials. With strong forensic cleaning awareness, our remediation\n    experts work promptly to sanitise the affected property including cleaning or removing any contaminated items or\n    furnishings to restore the property back to a safe and habitable, biohazard contamination free state. Our Death and\n    Suicide Clean Up technicians understand the importance of discretion and professionalism.\n  </p>\n</div>\n<button class=\"accordion\">METH LAB REMEDIATION PERTH | WA</button>\n<div class=\"panel\">\n  <h2>Meth Lab Decontamination and Remediation Services</h2>\n  <p style=\"text-align: left\">\n    As the number of meth labs being found increases, so to does the risks associated with unmediated meth lab\n    properties for not only current occupants, but future occupants. Crime Scene Cleaner Perth meth lab decontamination\n    technicians prides themselves in being Western Australia’s premier meth lab remediation company. Each one of our\n    specialised meth lab remediation technicians have extensive experience and knowledge in dealing with all aspects of\n    the job. Ranging in scale from small ‘shake and bake’ operations to sophisticated and highly toxic and volatile\n    operations, the chemicals and hazardous nature of chemical by-products found in these labs poses a significant risk\n    for those who operate these labs, and anyone in the vicinity. According to the 2016 Australian Crime Commission\n    report, the majority of clandestine laboratories continue to be detected in residential areas, with increased\n    detections in public places, rural and commercial locations in 2014–15. What is more alarming is that of the 667\n    meth labs detected, it is estimated that number represents only 10% of the total methamphetamine drug labs in\n    Australia. And of that number, nearly all crop up in rental properties that are then re-leased after the lab is\n    removed.\n  </p>\n\n  <h2>Why is a Meth Lab Remediation in Perth a Vital Service</h2>\n  <p style=\"text-align: left\">\n    In Perth and Western Australia, the police exit the picture very early on. They won’t provide the meth lab\n    remediation service; they’ll just take the evidence they need. They will then issue a notice to the environmental\n    health officer at the local government and it’s their responsibility to contact the property owner. Sometimes the\n    lab isn’t detected. As meth is a drug with an enormous waste to product ratio (six parts toxic runoff to every one\n    part of saleable meth), a house can be a poisonous place if no one’s cleaned it up. Meth lab remediation in Perth\n    and Western Australia can involve a number of stringent and important steps to ensure the property is left in a\n    non-hazardous, occupiable state. Methamphetamine production, or ‘cooking’ methods are almost always crude and hugely\n    dangerous, where precursors, reagents, solvents, and waste products pose risks to the short, and long-term health of\n    those unknowingly exposed to them. Residue of the manufacturing process contaminates properties throughout the\n    country, where no standardised method of meth lab decontamination exists.\n  </p>\n\n  <h2>What does Perth and Western Australia Meth Lab Remediation Entail</h2>\n  <p style=\"text-align: left\">\n    Crime Scene Cleaner Perth Meth Lab decontamination experts follow a stringent and methodical proven process to\n    ensure the property is remediated to a hazard and chemical free zone. We provide a comprehensive meth lab\n    restoration and remediation service across Perth and Western Australian cities, towns and regional areas. Once any\n    materials have been removed, our technicians will conduct an onsite survey to gain a preliminary assessment of the\n    affected area and complete a remediation action plan. Next, pre-forensic testing is required to establish\n    contamination levels and areas that are affected. Preliminary meth lab testing is crucial and will significantly\n    reduce costs associated in the meth lab remediation process by singling out contaminated areas only and the\n    automatic discarding of any furnishings or materials too contaminated to be cleaned.\n  </p>\n\n  <h2>Why Choose Crime Scene Cleaner Perth for Clandestine Drug Lab Remediation</h2>\n  <p style=\"text-align: left\">\n    Our Meth Lab Remediation technicians follow a stringent and methodical proven process to ensure the property is\n    remediated to a hazard and chemical free zone. The post-forensic test and validation for re-habitation is a crucial\n    step of the decontamination process. The property will be re-tested and samples sent to an independent laboratory\n    for analysis.

This odour permeates contents and structural elements of the property and can be difficult to remove. The lingering odour and airborne bacteria that a decomposing body produces can ruin household items in just a few days.</p>\n<h2 style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Removing the Odour left from Death</h2>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Removing the odours caused by a decomposing body should be handled by a suitably qualified professional. Any disposable supplies used in the clean-up must be properly discarded and transported. Biohazard remediation companies such as Crime Scene Cleaners Perth are trained on how to handle a wide range of situations and possess the knowledge, experience, tools, and protective equipment to complete the job wholly. Some of the supplies and chemicals utilised include:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 60px;\">Biohazard waste containers</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 60px;\">Ozone generators (to remove odours)</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 60px;\">Hospital-grade disinfectants</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 60px;\">Enzyme solvents</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 60px;\">Chemical treatment tanks</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Repainting your property and getting new carpet can help out with combating the smell left behind from a dead body. But these measures do not protect against exposure to the dangerous bacteria that is present.</p>\n<h2 style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Professional Death and Odour Removal Specialists</h2>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Any amount of human waste can be hazardous to our health. In fact, federal regulations deem all bodily fluids to be biohazards, and any blood, tissue, or bodily fluids at a scene are considered a potential source of infection. This includes odours that are left behind even after the body has been removed from the scene.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Here at Crime Scene Cleaners Perth, we believe that dealing with the emotional loss of a loved one is hard enough and that no family deserves to be plagued by disturbing images of decomposition, odour and potential health hazards. As the Western Australia’s leading biohazard remediation provider, we handle traumatic situations on a daily basis. Above all, our mission is to relieve each customer’s burden by providing compassionate, customer-centric, conscientious care in the delivery of our services.</p>\n","slug":"dealing-with-death-and-odour-cleaning","tags":{"nodes":[{"name":"Biohazard Remediation Clean Ups","slug":"biohazard-remediation-clean-ups","id":"dGVybToyMw=="},{"name":"Crime Scene Cleaners Perth","slug":"crime-scene-cleaners-perth","id":"dGVybToyMQ=="},{"name":"Death Scene Cleaning Perth","slug":"death-scene-cleaning-perth","id":"dGVybTozMw=="},{"name":"Unattended Death Clean Ups Perth","slug":"unattended-death-clean-ups-perth","id":"dGVybTozMg=="}]},"author":{"node":{"name":"admin"}},"excerpt":"<p>When somebody dies, particularly if not found for weeks or even months, an unpleasant odour can be left behind.

There are between 10 and 15 million Americans that struggle with hoarding issues and their disorder typically goes through stages that get increasingly more severe as the disorder develops. Matt Paxton, the host of the television show “Hoarders” and founder of ServiceMaster’s hoarding solutions program, has come up with 5 stages of hoarding that he presents at his speaking engagements to educate people on the warning signs of hoarding and what causes hoarding.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3>Emotional Cause</h3>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1458\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1458\"

class=\"wp-caption-text\">The biggest sign of a hoarder in this stage is that the individual will start buying things in bulk to have more physical objects around them.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>In almost all cases of hoarding, there is an emotional trigger that can be pinpointed to the start of the problem. This emotional cause can be grief from a variety of scenarios such as the loss of a loved one, a divorce, or disease among others.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3>Physical Replacement</h3>\n<p>When hoarding disorders intensify, the individual will place their self-worth in physical objects. The biggest sign of a hoarder in this stage is that the individual will start buying things in bulk to have more physical objects around them.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3>Avoidance</h3>\n<p>If you have a family member or close friend that you suspect may be a hoarder, pay attention to who they allow in their home, if anyone. Someone who is preventing friends or family members from entering their home may be doing it to avoid confronting their hoarding issue.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3>Negative Physical Replacement</h3>\n<p>As the hoarding disorder develops, the physical replacement becomes more extreme as objects begin replacing friends and family in importance. This is especially apparent if a hoarder has lost a loved one and responds by getting more objects or animals to clutter their home.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3>Dangerous Condition</h3>\n<p>As the hoard of collected items within a home grows, it begins to restrict access by blocking off certain areas of the home and it can harbour harmful mould and bacteria growth which makes the house dangerous to live in. This is usually the stage when family members recognise that an individual is hoarding and help with the hoarding clean-up process.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>It is important to keep in mind that everyone is different and these signs of hoarding may not manifest themselves in the same way in each individual case. But if you notice any similarity between these signs of a hoarder and the actions of a friend or family member that you suspect of hoarding, it is best to approach this individual about their hoarding disorder before it develops into a more severe case.</p>\n<p>A friend or family member of a hoarder normally assumes the responsibility of helping a hoarder clean out their home and there are professional services that can help. <a href=\"https://crimescenecleanerperth.com.au/\">Crime Scene Cleaners Perth</a> technicians offer hoarding clean-up services to determine the best way to approach an individual who hoards as well as the appropriate cleaning methods.</p>\n","slug":"5-warning-signs-of-a-hoarding-disorder","tags":{"nodes":[{"name":"hoarders clean ups perth","slug":"hoarders-clean-ups-perth","id":"dGVybToxNw=="}]},"author":{"node":{"name":"admin"}},"excerpt":"<p>To many people, it is difficult to understand hoarding disorders or how people that struggle with hoarding issues can allow their homes to fall into a messy and dangerous condition.

Some of these include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Treating each situation as potentially dangerous. Don’t ever assume a situation involving biohazards will be fine to respond to without proper precautions.</li>\n<li>Washing your hands frequently with warm water and soap.</li>\n<li>Wearing personal protective equipment (PPE) when responding to situations involving biohazards. These can include gloves, face masks and shields, respirators, aprons, special protective eyewear, and full body gowns or suits.</li>\n<li>Utilising appropriate disposal methods including labelled biohazard bags or containers.</li>\n<li>Reporting all incidents to your supervisor.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<p>When dealing with workplace biohazards, any potential contact should be treated with the utmost care to avoid risk and harm to employees. As a result, it is often best to call a bioremediation company for help with biohazards clean ups. <a href=\"https://crimescenecleanerperth.com.au\">Crime Scene Cleaner Perth</a> is an industry leader in biohazard remediation processes to ensure your workplace is clean and safe for everyone.

Before forensic clean up begins, the technicians establish three zones: The control zone (where the clean up takes place), the buffer zone (where technicians put on personal protective equipment), and the clean zone (where technicians store their equipment). The purpose of forensic cleaners establishing these three zones is to prevent cross contamination of the worksite and help prevent the transmission of potential blood borne pathogens.</li>\n<li>Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). PPE includes goggles, shoe coverings, biohazard suits, respirators, and double layer gloves.</li>\n<li>Vaccinations. Before beginning work, most forensic cleaners are required to get HBV and HCV vaccinations.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Why Choose Crime Scene Cleaners Perth for Your Forensic Cleaning</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://crimescenecleanerperth.com.au/\">Crime Scene Cleaners Perth</a> is a premier Forensic Cleaning and Biohazard Remediation company, dedicated to easing emotional trauma and property damage and contamination for those who have had a homicide, suicide, or unattended death in their home or place of business.

Pipes</strong>: Once you spot the stain, inspect all angles of the damage, including the roof, the floor above, and even the floorboards. Although you may want to check the floorboards last to avoid removing parts of the floor. But if you have checked all other areas, listen carefully to see if you can hear water running through the building materials. If so, the damage was caused by a leaking pipe under floors and behind walls.</p>\n<p><strong>Old and Out-dated Piping</strong>: Especially for older homes, the plumbing system may be out-dated and develop leaks more easily than others. In other cases, the pipes can also “sweat” water, in which the insulation is cheap, old, or installed improperly, causing water to drip from the pipes.</p>\n<p><strong>Roof Problems</strong>: For water stains on ceilings on the top floor of the home or building, you will have to grab a ladder and climb onto your roof to find the problem. You may also need to hire a roofing contractor for this job, but at least you will have already identified the problem, thus keeping labour costs efficient.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Never Ignore Ceiling Water Damage</h3>\n<p>While addressing ceiling water stains is never an exciting task to do on the weekends, ignoring the damage will only lead to bigger problems down the road.

People who suffer from a hoarding disorder will keep all kinds of items with a lot of it not having any important value. This can include newspapers, broken appliances, junk mail and a lot of irrelevant things. It can be very difficult to persuade hoarders to dispose of useless items as they think that the items are repairable in the future.</p>\n<h3>Loss of Space in The House</h3>\n<p>People who have hoarding disorders are reluctant to throw away old belongings, and they begin to run out of space around the house. Those saved belongings may be organised initially, but eventually they can spread around the house and make your living space uncomfortable and uninhabitable.</p>\n<h3>Unclean and Disorganised Atmosphere</h3>\n<p>If you notice that any of your family has so much clutter around the house that there is no sense of organisation, the person might have a hoarding disorder. This great sense of disorganisation can lead to a very crowded and unsanitary living condition. Many hoarders can’t locate items in their home because there is too much clutter to enable them to effectively find any.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Gross Filth and Hoarding can cause significant issues to those living in this kind of environment with an increased level of pollutants in the air and biological risks with increased levels of mildew and mould growth as well as rodents, faeces and urine which can have severe health implications if not remediated. Additionally, living in a house with a gross filth, squaller or hoarding issue can lead to the increased risk of a fall and in some extreme cases, being trapped among the hoarding mess. Potential structural damage can occur to the property if the hoarding mess is left for an extended period of time and the risk of a house fire increases significantly.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://crimescenecleanerperth.com.au/\">Crime Scene Cleaners Perth</a> technicians provide a compassionate and understanding gross filth and hoarders clean up service with a tactful, respectful and caring approach during the entire process and are able to encourage your loved one to find a happy and healthy balance between items that are important and have sentimental value to keep, and the items that are not needed.</p>\n<p>There is no shame in this struggle, and you should never be made to feel bad about this.
