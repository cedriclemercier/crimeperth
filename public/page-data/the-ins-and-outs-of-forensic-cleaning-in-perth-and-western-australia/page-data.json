Doing so safely often requires specialized equipment and knowledge that the average population does not possess.</p>\n<p>Exposure to potentially infectious materials (PIM) can cause serious illness or disease if the blood or body fluids that you are exposed to are infected with blood borne pathogens.</p>\n<p>Some blood borne pathogens of concern include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)</li>\n<li>Hepatitis B and C (HBV, HCV)</li>\n<li>Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus (MRSA)</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>When is Forensic Cleaning Required?</h3>\n<p>If your home, business, or property has been contaminated with potentially bio hazardous material, it is recommended that you reach out to a forensic cleaning company for assistance. Forensic cleaning companies are trained in local and federal rules and regulations that impact returning your property to a livable condition. They can safely handle the clean up of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Suicides</li>\n<li>Unattended deaths</li>\n<li>Hoarding situations</li>\n<li>Communicable disease contamination</li>\n<li>Homicides</li>\n<li>Tear gas incidents</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>What Precautions to Forensic Cleaners Take to Ensure the Safety of Themselves and Others from Infection?</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Contamination Control. Before forensic clean up begins, the technicians establish three zones: The control zone (where the clean up takes place), the buffer zone (where technicians put on personal protective equipment), and the clean zone (where technicians store their equipment). The purpose of forensic cleaners establishing these three zones is to prevent cross contamination of the worksite and help prevent the transmission of potential blood borne pathogens.</li>\n<li>Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). PPE includes goggles, shoe coverings, biohazard suits, respirators, and double layer gloves.</li>\n<li>Vaccinations. Before beginning work, most forensic cleaners are required to get HBV and HCV vaccinations.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Why Choose Crime Scene Cleaners Perth for Your Forensic Cleaning</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://crimescenecleanerperth.com.au/\">Crime Scene Cleaners Perth</a> is a premier Forensic Cleaning and Biohazard Remediation company, dedicated to easing emotional trauma and property damage and contamination for those who have had a homicide, suicide, or unattended death in their home or place of business.
