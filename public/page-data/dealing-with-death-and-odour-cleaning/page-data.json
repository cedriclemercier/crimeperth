This odour permeates contents and structural elements of the property and can be difficult to remove. The lingering odour and airborne bacteria that a decomposing body produces can ruin household items in just a few days.</p>\n<h2 style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Removing the Odour left from Death</h2>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Removing the odours caused by a decomposing body should be handled by a suitably qualified professional. Any disposable supplies used in the clean-up must be properly discarded and transported. Biohazard remediation companies such as Crime Scene Cleaners Perth are trained on how to handle a wide range of situations and possess the knowledge, experience, tools, and protective equipment to complete the job wholly. Some of the supplies and chemicals utilised include:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 60px;\">Biohazard waste containers</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 60px;\">Ozone generators (to remove odours)</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 60px;\">Hospital-grade disinfectants</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 60px;\">Enzyme solvents</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 60px;\">Chemical treatment tanks</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Repainting your property and getting new carpet can help out with combating the smell left behind from a dead body. But these measures do not protect against exposure to the dangerous bacteria that is present.</p>\n<h2 style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Professional Death and Odour Removal Specialists</h2>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Any amount of human waste can be hazardous to our health. In fact, federal regulations deem all bodily fluids to be biohazards, and any blood, tissue, or bodily fluids at a scene are considered a potential source of infection. This includes odours that are left behind even after the body has been removed from the scene.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Here at Crime Scene Cleaners Perth, we believe that dealing with the emotional loss of a loved one is hard enough and that no family deserves to be plagued by disturbing images of decomposition, odour and potential health hazards.
