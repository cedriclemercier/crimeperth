Disease-causing bacteria, viruses, and other biohazards are microscopic, so even though the scene may appear to be clean after using normal household cleaning methods, these hazards may still be present. That is why it’s critical to bring in professional biohazard clean-up services to ensure your home or business is thoroughly clean and safe for occupancy.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Comprehensive Biohazard Remediation Requires Specialised Skills</h3>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1446\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1446\" style=\"width: 300px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-1446\" src=\"http://crimescenecleanerperth.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/biohazard-clean-ups-crime-scene-cleaner-perth-300x195.jpg\" alt=\"The importance of having the scene of a death or accident where biohazard materials are present professionally cleaned cannot be overstated\" width=\"300\" height=\"195\" srcset=\"https://admin.crimescenecleanerperth.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/biohazard-clean-ups-crime-scene-cleaner-perth-300x195.jpg 300w, https://admin.crimescenecleanerperth.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/biohazard-clean-ups-crime-scene-cleaner-perth.jpg 380w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1446\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The importance of having the scene of a death or accident where biohazard materials are present professionally cleaned cannot be overstated</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Cleaning a contaminated scene to eliminate any biohazards that may be present starts with a thorough understanding of the scientific and biological processes that lead to unsafe conditions. At Crime Scene Cleaners Perth, our technicians have extensive training in identifying potentially contaminated materials at the scene and in the most effective methods to disinfect and decontaminate, and properly dispose of bio hazardous materials.</p>\n<p>The importance of having the scene of a death or accident professionally cleaned cannot be overstated. Blood and body tissue may contain pathogens that pose a serious health threat, such as HIV, Hepatitis B, and Hepatitis C. If an unattended death has occurred and was undiscovered for several days, the natural decomposition process can make decontamination more complex, since bodily fluids and tissues can be soaked into carpets, subfloors, under tiles and grout and more.</p>\n<h3></h3>\n<h3>Perth Biohazard Remediation Services</h3>\n<p>Our <a href=\"http://crimescenecleanerperth.com.au/\">biohazard remediation in Perth</a> are performed in strict accordance with regulations established legislative bodies for appropriate biohazard removal and clean up.
