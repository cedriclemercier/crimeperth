class=\"wp-caption-text\">When sewage or water has entered your home due to a flood, severe rainstorm, clogged pipes or broken sewer lines, it must be cleaned up before contaminants can begin to spread throughout your property</figcaption></figure>\n<p>All types of sewage contain viruses, bacteria and harmful microbes, but some are worse than others.</p>\n<h4>Category 1</h4>\n<p>The most common sewage leak is Category 1. It’s liquid from a clean source, including faucets, toilet tanks, leaky water pipes and water coolers. It can turn into category 2 or 3 if not treated quickly.</p>\n<h4>Category 2</h4>\n<p>Also known as grey water, this liquid contains contaminants known to cause illness, discomfort and disease. It’s usually found from leaking or faulty sources including toilet overflows, not including faeces, dishwasher or washing machine overflow, and flush from sink drains.</p>\n<h4>Category 3</h4>\n<p>This type of sewage spill is the nastiest and foulest offender and can cause severe illness or even death. Known as black water, its sources include sewer backup, flooding from rivers or streams, toilet overflow with faeces, and stagnant water that has begun to support bacterial growth.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Why use Crime Scene Cleaners Perth for your Sewage and Water Restoration Needs</h3>\n<p>Homeowners are advised to only utilise appropriately trained and certified sewage remediation technicians.
