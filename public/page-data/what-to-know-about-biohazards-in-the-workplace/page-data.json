Don’t ever assume a situation involving biohazards will be fine to respond to without proper precautions.</li>\n<li>Washing your hands frequently with warm water and soap.</li>\n<li>Wearing personal protective equipment (PPE) when responding to situations involving biohazards. These can include gloves, face masks and shields, respirators, aprons, special protective eyewear, and full body gowns or suits.</li>\n<li>Utilising appropriate disposal methods including labelled biohazard bags or containers.</li>\n<li>Reporting all incidents to your supervisor.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<p>When dealing with workplace biohazards, any potential contact should be treated with the utmost care to avoid risk and harm to employees.
