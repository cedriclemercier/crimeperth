Although you may want to check the floorboards last to avoid removing parts of the floor. But if you have checked all other areas, listen carefully to see if you can hear water running through the building materials. If so, the damage was caused by a leaking pipe under floors and behind walls.</p>\n<p><strong>Old and Out-dated Piping</strong>: Especially for older homes, the plumbing system may be out-dated and develop leaks more easily than others. In other cases, the pipes can also “sweat” water, in which the insulation is cheap, old, or installed improperly, causing water to drip from the pipes.</p>\n<p><strong>Roof Problems</strong>: For water stains on ceilings on the top floor of the home or building, you will have to grab a ladder and climb onto your roof to find the problem. You may also need to hire a roofing contractor for this job, but at least you will have already identified the problem, thus keeping labour costs efficient.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Never Ignore Ceiling Water Damage</h3>\n<p>While addressing ceiling water stains is never an exciting task to do on the weekends, ignoring the damage will only lead to bigger problems down the road. The longer the stain is left alone, the damage will continue to spread over time and can even become permanent if not addressed quickly.</p>\n","seo":{"metaDesc":"","metaRobotsNofollow":"follow","metaRobotsNoindex":"index","opengraphDescription":"Nothing can be more worrying than to find a ceiling water stain.
