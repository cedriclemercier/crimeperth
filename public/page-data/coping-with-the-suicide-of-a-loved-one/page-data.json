But, for most, the pain cannot be put off indefinably. It may not be until days, weeks, or even months following the death that the reality is fully comprehended, both cognitively and emotionally, and the intense feelings of sadness, longing, and emptiness may not peak until after that recognition sets in.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1436\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1436\" style=\"width: 300px\" class=\"wp-caption

has lost a loved one to suicide, dealing with the emotions that follow can be exceedingly traumatic. What many people do not realise is that cleaning up the scene is largely the responsibility of the family, an unthinkable task for those mourning the unexpected death of a family member or friend. On top of the emotional trauma that goes along with a suicide clean-up, there are health hazards to consider as well. The scene of a suicide is likely a traumatic one, with bodily components that can pose serious health threats such as HIV and hepatitis, viruses that do not necessarily show outward signs of illness. When cleaning up after a suicide, it is vital to protect yourself from exposure to these biohazards.</p>\n<p>Cleaning up after a suicide is often traumatic and overwhelming for loved ones and friends.
