Immediately following the death, bereaved individuals often experience feelings of numbness, shock, and denial.</p>\n<p>For some, this denial is adaptive as it provides a brief respite from the pain, allowing time and energy to accept the death and to deal with practical implications including planning a funeral, doing what is necessary for children or others affected by the loss and settling the estate of the deceased. But, for most, the pain cannot be put off indefinably. It may not be until days, weeks, or even months following the death that the reality is fully comprehended, both cognitively and emotionally, and the intense feelings of sadness, longing, and emptiness may not peak until after that recognition sets in.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1436\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1436\" style=\"width: 300px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-1436\" src=\"http://crimescenecleanerperth.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/crime-scene-cleaners-perth-coping-wth-the-suicide-of-a-loved-one-300x167.jpg\" alt=\"For the family and friends who have lost a loved one to suicide, dealing with the emotions that follow can be exceedingly traumatic\" width=\"300\" height=\"167\" srcset=\"https://admin.crimescenecleanerperth.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/crime-scene-cleaners-perth-coping-wth-the-suicide-of-a-loved-one-300x167.jpg 300w, https://admin.crimescenecleanerperth.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/crime-scene-cleaners-perth-coping-wth-the-suicide-of-a-loved-one.jpg 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1436\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">For the family and friends who have lost a loved one to suicide, dealing with the emotions that follow can be exceedingly traumatic</figcaption></figure>\n<p>For someone who has lost a loved one to suicide, dealing with the emotions that follow can be exceedingly traumatic. What many people do not realise is that cleaning up the scene is largely the responsibility of the family, an unthinkable task for those mourning the unexpected death of a family member or friend. On top of the emotional trauma that goes along with a suicide clean-up, there are health hazards to consider as well. The scene of a suicide is likely a traumatic one, with bodily components that can pose serious health threats such as HIV and hepatitis, viruses that do not necessarily show outward signs of illness.
